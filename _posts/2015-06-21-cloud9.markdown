Sign up for a [Github](https://github.com/) account.

Then, go to the [cloud9 website](https://c9.io/).

Click the __signup__ button. Signup using the github account you just created.

Once you have signed up, you will be shown your dashboard. __Create a New workspace__ by clicking the green plus icon.

Name your new workspace _railsgirls_, and make sure you are creating a Ruby workspace. Then click 'Create workspace'.

You will then be taken directly to your new workspace.

## Upgrading to Rails Version 5
By default Cloud9 comes with rails version 4 installed. But there is a newer version of Rails available and at Rails Girls
we like to stay ahead of the game. Lets upgrade our environment to Rails 5

These steps can be a little tricky so if you are unsure just ask a mentor for help. Lets get started

1. Ensure your cursor is in the bash window (also known as terminal window, see the screen shot below) and type `gem install rails`

2. When completed type `sudo apt-get update` this will ensure we have the latest packages

3. Next type `rails new rails5-proj` this will be a temp project, we will remove it a bit later

4. Then enter `mv workspace workspace.bck` here we are taking a backup of our workspace (its the workspace with the old version of Rails and we don't really need it again but generally it's safer to rename a directory than deleting esp when you are learning)

5. Enter `mkdir workspace` here we are making a new workspace, this will be for our Rails 5 version. The Blog App that we are about to build will be contained within the workspace folder. 

6. Enter `cd rails5-proj` this will  move you into the **rails5-proj** directory

7. Then `cp -r  * ../workspace` here we are simply copying everything into our new workspace directory (this is the Rails 5 one)

8. Type `cd ..` to simply move up one level in the directory structure and then type `ls` to see a list of the files in the current directory. It should be similar to this

9. You should see a folder called  **rails5_proj** we are going to remove it now, simply type `rm -rf rails5_proj`

10. Finally move into the workspace folder so we can start building our Rails 5 app, type `cd workspace`

11. Let type `bundle install` so we know all our gems are up to date (gems are basically libraries that contains pre-written code so that you don't have to write it from scratch)


## Workspace environment

<img src="/images/c9/c9-project-workspace-annotated.png"  width="600>

The workspace is made up of a few important areas.

- The file explorer and editor are where we will be spending a lot of time. Choose files to edit using the explorer. They will open in a new tab in the file editor.
- Run Project Button. We will use this to start and stop our Rails application.
- The Terminal is used to enter commands to our application.

## Set up the text editor

The Ruby global convention is to use 2 spaces for indentation. Lets change the default editor to use 2 spaces.

Click on the settings icon in the upper right side of the window. A preferences window will open edit the __Soft Tabs__ setting to reduce it to 2.

## Viewing your project in the Browser

From the ruby-railsgirls terminal you need to start the rails server. Click the 'Run Project' button.

Click on the share button in the top right window. From the __Share this workspace__ window click on the url in Application and select the open option
